# Machine-Learning-Knowledge-Vault
This repo contains a list of core ML reference and learning materials

This is by no means a comprehensive list on the subject of ML/AI. However, I find that these books tackle a wide range of subjects one is likely to encounter in machine learning. Although I have included application-specific books, such as those on computer vision, I have intentionally left out others, like those in NLP. A good number of these books cover knowledge that can be applied across almost any field of machine learning. You might also note that a significant portion of these books are more focused on theory than on hands-on practice. I firmly believe that there is nothing as practical as a good theory. For more hands-on books, there are plenty available, some of which are free. I find the resources here to be particularly insightful: [Datanovia Shop](https://www.datanovia.com/en/shop/). Recent developments in ML can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) as the field is evolving rapidly. I also think it's important to have a look at ML theses from different universities. It helps to see how other people approach ML. In addition to books on ML, I have added a few on mathematics. I think one gains a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts by also having a passion for pure mathematics. Some of the fields I would definitely recommend include Abstract Linear Algebra, Abstract Algebra (particularly groups), Measure Theory and Integration, Manifolds, Real, Complex, and Functional Analysis. Most of these are taught in sequence on [this YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdwo4k1RQHTcq_-WS7Cazqg).
